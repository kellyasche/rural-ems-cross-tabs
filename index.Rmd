The following narrative combines the executive summary written by the MN Department of Health with a summary of the results found in this analysis.

# Characteristics section

Most rural EMS agencies provide basic life support services to relatively small populations spread across large geographic areas. Along with low daily call volumes, these realities exacerbate the inability to create sustainable business and staffing models.

* The median call volume is nearly one call per day
* Over half of the agencies cover more than 200 square miles; 37 percent cover more than 300
square miles
* Over half of the agencies serve populations of less than 5,000

However, when we dig a bit deeper we tend to see that agencies that are more rural (serve smaller population sizes) follow the above narrative more so than agencies that are not as rural (serve large population sizes).

**Owned, managed, or receive support from a corporate health system**

Although only 27% of agencies responded that they were owned, managed or receive support from a corporate health care system,  

**Types of services provided** 

Although a very large majority of all agencies (88.2%) offer basic life support, agencies that serve a small population size were significantly more likely to provide this service - 96% of responses serving less than 2,500 and 98% of responses serving 2,500 - 4,999.

In addition, although only 27% of all agencies offer advanced life support, agencies that serve a large population size were significantly more likely to offer this service - 63% of responses serving 10,000 - 14,999 and 92% of responses serving 15,000 or more people.

Lastly, only 17% of all agencies responded that they offer part-time advanced life support. However, agencies serving moderate size populations were significantly more likely to offer this service - 47% of responses serving 5,000 - 9,999.

**Staff compensation**

A majority of agencies (57%) responded that they use a volunteer/on-call compensation structure for their staff. However, agencies that serve smaller sized populations were significantly more likely to use this framework for their staff compensation - 76% of responses serving less than 2,500 people and 77% of responses serving 2,500 - 4,999. On the flip side, only 20% of agencies responded that they paid their staff but it was much higher for agencies serving larger populations - 38% of responses serving 10,000 - 14,9999 and 84% of responses serving 15,000 people or more. 

**Using EMRs to staff ambulances**

Although a majority of agencies responded that they do NOT use EMRs to staff their ambulances, agencies that serve small populations DO staff their ambulances using EMRs - 65% of responses serving less than 2,500 people and 51% of responses serving 2,500 - 4,999 people.
